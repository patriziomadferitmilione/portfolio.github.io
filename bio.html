              I was a very lively child, doing lots of activities.
              <br />
              Through a friend of my dad's, I started acting and modelling at 2,
              which was quite the exciting hobby for a baby.
              <br />
              I started playing soccer at 4,
              <br />

              and not interested in school at all.

              writing songs at 17, I was obsessed with becoming a Rock 'n' Roll
              star. I would spend my days out with friends or playing my

              I decided that my career would be in IT. I needed a field in which
              I could be creative, constantly learn new things and be able to
              take part in the technological revolution we've been living for
              the past few decades. I liked the idea of having a job in demand,
              since I had spent the last 8 years chasing Rock 'n' Roll (some say
              it died long ago...). I also wanted the chance to self teach

              per week, while working full-time in a warehouse. Then, towards
              the end of January, I landed a Software Engineer internship in
              Turin. It was an intense 3 months full of learning.

              In may 2022 I took on a new challenge, as a Blockchain Developer.
              I started things off with the development of an Application that
              communicates with a Blockchain to certify the completion of
              courses.

              <br />
              Unfortunately, things didn't work out as I was the only developer
              on the project, and being junior and self-taught, I wanted to have
              experienced people around me to learn from.

              So I got a job at a software house to keep gaining new skills. We
              build a Project Management Software for enterprises and small
              businesses through a low code platform.
